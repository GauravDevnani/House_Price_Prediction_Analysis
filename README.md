House-Price-Prediction-Analysis 
This is a Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. The objective of the project is to perform data visulalization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning is often required to getting the understanding of the data and its insights. This project aims apply various Python tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning operation on it. The primary purpose was to implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, but, in addition i also predicted the sales price for each house & For each Id in the test set, also predicted the value of the SalePrice variable.  This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts.
